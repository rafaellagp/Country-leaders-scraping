## Biography of country leaders

Web Scraping Project: Biography of country leaders. (Source: Wikipedia.)

Project created in the trainee program of BeCode. The goal is to query an API for a list of countries and their past leaders. Then extract and sanitize their short bio from Wikipedia. Finally, save the data to disk. 

Here I explored topics such as: scraping, data structures, regular expressions, concurrency and file handling.

The aim is to practice coding skills according to the following steps:
1. create a self-contained development environment.
2. retrieve some information from an API
3. leverage it to scrape a website that does not provide an API
4. save the output for later processing.
